# 🍕 Pizza Sales Data Analysis using MySQL
This project demonstrates how MySQL can be used to analyze a real-world sales dataset from a fictional pizza business. The goal is to uncover valuable insights that can help improve sales performance, customer satisfaction, and operational efficiency.

# ✅ Project Overview
Objective:
To analyze pizza sales data and extract actionable business insights using structured SQL queries.

Dataset:
A CSV file containing order-level details such as order ID, date/time, pizza type, size, quantity, and price.

Tools Used:
MySQL, SQL Workbench, and Excel (for initial review and CSV formatting).

# 📊 Key Analysis and Insights
1. Total Revenue & Order Metrics
→ Calculated overall revenue, total orders, and average order value to understand the financial performance.

2. Top-Selling Pizzas
→ Identified best-performing pizzas by quantity sold and revenue generated to guide inventory and marketing strategies.

3. Sales by Pizza Category & Size
→ Analyzed which categories (Classic, Veggie, etc.) and sizes (S, M, L, XL) performed best in terms of volume and revenue.

4. Daily & Monthly Sales Trends
→ Tracked how sales fluctuate over days and months to identify seasonal patterns and peak periods.

5. Hourly Sales Distribution
→ Determined peak business hours by aggregating orders by time of day—helpful for staffing and promotions.

6. Busiest Days of the Week
→ Evaluated order frequency across weekdays to optimize operations and delivery scheduling.

7. Inventory & Restocking Insights
→ Based on sales volume of pizza types and sizes, provided suggestions for stock management and restocking priorities.

# 🛠️ Technical Highlights
Used JOINs, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, DATE functions, and aggregations (SUM, COUNT, AVG) for analysis.

Applied subqueries and CASE statements to build more advanced insights.

Data was cleaned and preprocessed for accurate and meaningful reporting.

# 💡 Outcome
This project reflects how a business can use SQL and data analytics to:

Make data-driven decisions

Increase profitability

Enhance customer satisfaction

Improve supply chain and operational planning
